### Classification Performance Measurement Matrics
Since Dataset is highly unbalanced, classification performance evaluated using following matrics:-
* Confusion Matrix
* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-Score
* Precision recall curve (PR Curve)

### ML Algorithms Implemented:
* Deep Feature Systhesis (FeatureTools)
* Manual Feature Generation
* Standard Scaled, Log Scaled and Normalized Data sets
* Feature Reduction
  * PCA - Linear Dimension reduction Algorithm
  * BernoulliRBM (Restricted Boltzmann machines) - Unsupervised Neural network Algorithm used as Non-Linear feature learner
* Oversampling using SMOTE algorithm
* Classification Algorithms:-
  * Adaboost 
  * RandomForest 
  * Decision Tree
  * Logistic Regression
  * QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis 
  * Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM )
* Unsupervised Learning (Clustering) output used as feature for classification:-
  * K-means Clustering
  * MiniBatchKMeans Clustering
